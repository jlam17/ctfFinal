Marooned on a deserted island in a maze by vengeful pirates in the magic age, you are made to fight another pirate exile. The winner of a best of five match will survive to be picked up by the pirate ship. Steal your opponent’s flag and make it back to your base to score a point. Power-ups of different types may manifest around the maze for your benefit. Be wary though, impartial enemies may appear to attack either player.
